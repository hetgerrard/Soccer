Question being researched
The question being researched is how can AI and generative image synthesis be used to reimagine and visually represent iconic Soccer Stars in new and innovative ways.

Why do we need graphic novels of soccer stars?

Diverse Representation: Graphic novels can showcase diverse characters, backgrounds, and experiences within the world of soccer. They provide an opportunity to highlight the stories of players from different cultures, genders, and backgrounds, promoting inclusivity and representation in the sport.
Inspiration and Role Models: Soccer-themed graphic novels can inspire young athletes by presenting relatable stories of perseverance, teamwork, and success on and off the field. They can introduce readers to soccer role models and their journeys to becoming top players.
Entertainment: Like any form of literature or entertainment, soccer-themed graphic novels can provide enjoyment and entertainment to fans of the sport. They can offer a unique and immersive way to experience soccer-related stories.

Why is it interesting?

Human Stories: Beyond the game itself, soccer is filled with human stories of triumph, adversity, teamwork, and personal growth. Graphic novels can delve into the personal journeys of players, coaches, and fans, adding depth and emotional resonance to the sport.
Visual Appeal: Soccer is a visually dynamic sport with fast-paced action, skillful plays, and moments of excitement. Graphic novels have the unique ability to capture these visual elements in a compelling way, making the sport more engaging and accessible to readers.

How do I plan on doing it?

Concept Development: Start by brainstorming ideas for your graphic novel. What story or theme do you want to explore within the world of soccer? Who are the main characters? What is the central conflict or message you want to convey?
Scriptwriting: Write a script or outline for your graphic novel. This should include the dialogue, narration, and descriptions of the visuals for each page or panel.

How will I know it is doing a good job?

Reader Reception: One of the most straightforward indicators of a graphic novel's success is how it is received by its target audience. Positive reviews, reader feedback, and reach can provide insights into whether the work is resonating with readers.
Critical Reviews: Reviews from critics and experts in the field can also be valuable for assessing the quality and impact of a graphic novel. Positive reviews from respected sources can be a good sign.

What work is expected every week?

Each week a number of iconic Soccer Stars will be selected to generate images for. New set of tags will be implemented like venue, sports etc. After a few weeks, the best outputs will be chosen and the parameter adjustments that had the most influence on creativity and quality will be analyzed. The goal is to build up a diverse collection showing the range of AI's creative potential for reenvisioning pop culture icons.

This repository contains a collection of Soccer Stars images generated by Midjourney along with related notebooks and tags. The Soccer_Stars folder is organized as follows:
